# Fostering Hope @snap

# Introduction

> “Fostering Hope @ Snap” allows foster youth to have access to local resources like housing, food banks and creative arts programs through a kinder, easier, interactive SnapMap.

# Main Features

## Different resources on the map

> The map provides some basic information like the locations and contacts, which is collected from our trusted resources and stored in our database. Different icons for food banks, creative art programs, and shelters are included.

## Introduction Video

> For our users to have a better understanding of the organization, we provided an option button called ‘ABOUT US’, once the user presses the button it would direct them to another screen where they will see an introduction video of the organization that explains what they do and what they provide them.
